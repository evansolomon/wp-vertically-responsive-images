Resize images on the fly to make sure the whole thing fits into the user's window.

== Description ==

Usually when we talk about making something responsive, we mean horizontally.  But it's annoying when tall images overflow a short laptop screen.  This resizes those images on the fly to fit the user's window.  Optionally disable it for individual images by adding a `do-not-resize` class.

== Installation ==

Normal stuff, wp-content/plugins
